This page describes how to configure SpamPAD.

.. _configuration-files:

Configuration files
===================

The SpamPAD configuration can be separated into multiple files. These are read
from the `configpath` and `sitepath` directories. You can change these
locations using the `-C` or `-S` options of the daemon and CLI script.

More files can be included from other location by using the include option::

    # This include a different file
    include /etc/spampad/custom_prefs.cf

Users can also configure custom preferences in their home directory when
running the CLI script. This location is also customizable with the `-P`
option. Note that daemon does NOT accept user preferences by default and you
will have to enable it with `allow_user_rules`.

.. note::

    The order the files IS important as it determines the order of the rules
    loading and executing. To change the order in which the rules are checked
    see the :ref:`priority rule option <priority-rule-options>`.

.. _configuration-types:

Configuration types
===================

SpamPAD accepts various types of configuration options. The current types are:

**int**
    Integer number.
**float**
    Floating point number.
**bool**
    Boolean value, can be one of: 1, 0, True, False.
**str**
    A simple string value.
**list**
    A comma separated list of strings. For example defining this::

        pyzor_servers public.pyzor.org,my.pyzor.example.com

    Will be evaluated as::

        ["public.pyzor.org", "my.pyzor.example.com"]

    Defining the same option multiple time WILL override the previous
    setting.
**append**
    This option can be specified multiple times without overriding previous
    settings. Every time the option is specified the values are appended to
    to a list. For example for the report option::

        report This message is was marked as spam on _HOSTNAME_.
        report The message score was _SCORE_.
        report Contact me at _CONTACTADDRESS_.

    Will result in the final option being evaluated as::

        ["This message is was marked as spam on _HOSTNAME_.",
         "The message score was _SCORE_.",
         "Contact me at _CONTACTADDRESS_."]
**clear**
    Clears one or more of the append type option.

Options
=======

.. _filtering-options:

Filtering options
-----------------

**required_score** 5.0 (type `float`)
    Set minimum required score for a message to get for it to be treated as
    spam.
**use_bayes**: True (type `bool`)
    Controls whether or not the bayesian filter should be checked.
**use_network**: True (type `bool`)
    Controls whether or not network checks should be perfomed on the message.
**envelope_sender_header**: ["X-Sender", "X-Envelope-From", "Envelope-Sender", "Return-Path", "From"] (type `append`)
    Specifies which header should be used when determining the envelope sender
    of the message.
**allow_user_rules**: False (type `bool`)
    If set to True the daemon will also load user preferences. Note that this
    can be a possible security risk, which is why it's disabled by default.


Message modifications
---------------------

**add_header** [] (type `append`)
    Adds one header to the message. The value for this option must be in the
    following format::

        add_header [all|spam|ham] [header_name] [header_value]

    If the first argument is `all` then the header is added to ALL
    messages. Otherwise the header is added only to messages that were
    classified as spam or ham. Note that the header name will be append with
    `X-Spam-` and the header string ill have any TAGS replaced with their
    values. For example::

        add_header all PAD-Report Checked with SpamPAD _SCORE_

    Will add a new header to every message like::

        X-Spam-PAD-Report: Checked with SpamPAD <score>
**remove_header** [] (type `append`)
    Removes all header from message with the specified name. The value for this
    option must be in the following format::

         remove_header [all|spam|ham] [header_name]

**clear_headers** N/A (type `clear`)
    Clear all previously set options that add or remove headers (i.e. any
    from `add_header` or `remove_header`).

.. _reporting-options:

Reporting
---------

**report** [] (type `append`)
    A list of strings that form the report. The report can be returned when
    the CLI script is called with `-t` and is also included by default in
    messages that have been marked as spam. Note that this string will have
    any TAGS replaced with their values.
**clear_report_template** N/A (type `clear`)
    Clear the report list.
**report_safe** 1 (type `int`)
    When this option is set to 0 only header modification are made to the
    messages. In addition an X-Spam-Report will be added to the messages that
    contains the `report` for this message. Note this only applies to
    messages classified as spam.

    When this option is set to 1 and the messages is marked as spam, SpamPAD
    will generate a multipart/mixed messages. The new message will have
    `text/plain` part with the SpamPAD report and `message/rfc882` part with
    the original message.

    When the option is set to 2 instead of using a `messages/rfc882` content
    type, a text/plain one will be used instead.
**report_contact** None (type `str`)
    Set the contact address that is exposed in the `_CONTACTADDRESS_` tag.

        dns_server 127.0.0.1:53
        dns_server [::1]:53

    If no such nameserver is specified, the default ones from `/etc/resolv.conf`
    will be used.
**clear_dns_servers** N/A (type `clear`)
    Clear any custom nameserver set by `dns_server`.
**default_dns_lifetime** 10.0 (type `float`)
    Sets the timeout for a full DNS lookup. I.e. any DNS lookup will have at
    most 10 seconds to get a valid response from one of the DNS server.
