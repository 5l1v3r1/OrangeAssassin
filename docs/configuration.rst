This page describes how to configure SpamPAD.

.. _configuration-files:

Configuration files
===================

The SpamPAD configuration can be separated into multiple files. These are read
from the `configpath` and `sitepath` directories. You can change these
locations using the `-C` or `-S` options of the daemon and CLI script.

More files can be included from other location by using the include option::

    # This include a different file
    include /etc/spampad/custom_prefs.cf

Users can also configure custom preferences in their home directory when
running the CLI script. This location is also customizable with the `-P`
option. Note that daemon does NOT accept user preferences by default and you
will have to enable it with `allow_user_rules`.

.. note::

    The order the files IS important as it determines the order of the rules
    loading and executing. To change the order in which the rules are checked
    see the :ref:`priority rule option <priority-rule-options>`.

.. _configuration-types:

Configuration types
===================

SpamPAD accepts various types of configuration options. The current types are:

**int**
    Integer number.
**float**
    Floating point number.
**bool**
    Boolean value, can be one of: 1, 0, True, False.
**str**
    A simple string value.
**list**
    A comma separated list of strings. For example defining this::

        pyzor_servers public.pyzor.org,my.pyzor.example.com

    Will be evaluated as::

        ["public.pyzor.org", "my.pyzor.example.com"]

    Defining the same option multiple time WILL override the previous
    setting.
**append**
    This option can be specified multiple times without overriding previous
    settings. Every time the option is specified the values are appended to
    to a list. For example for the report option::

        report This message was marked as spam on _HOSTNAME_.
        report The message score was _SCORE_.
        report Contact me at _CONTACTADDRESS_.

    Will result in the final option being evaluated as::

        ["This message was marked as spam on _HOSTNAME_.",
         "The message score was _SCORE_.",
         "Contact me at _CONTACTADDRESS_."]
**clear**
    Clears one or more of the append type option.

.. _configuration-options:

Options
=======

.. _filtering-options:

Filtering options
-----------------

**required_score** 5.0 (type `float`)
    Set minimum required score for a message to get for it to be treated as
    spam.
**use_bayes** True (type `bool`)
    Controls whether or not the bayesian filter should be checked.
**use_network** True (type `bool`)
    Controls whether or not network checks should be perfomed on the message.
**envelope_sender_header** ["X-Sender", "X-Envelope-From", "Envelope-Sender", "Return-Path", "From"] (type `append`)
    Specifies which header should be used when determining the envelope sender
    of the message.
**allow_user_rules** False (type `bool`)
    If set to True the daemon will also load user preferences. Note that this
    can be a possible security risk, which is why it's disabled by default.


Message modifications
---------------------

**add_header** [] (type `append`)
    Adds one header to the message. The value for this option must be in the
    following format::

        add_header [all|spam|ham] [header_name] [header_value]

    If the first argument is `all` then the header is added to ALL
    messages. Otherwise the header is added only to messages that were
    classified as spam or ham. Note that the header name will be append with
    `X-Spam-` and the header string ill have any TAGS replaced with their
    values. For example::

        add_header all PAD-Report Checked with SpamPAD _SCORE_

    Will add a new header to every message like::

        X-Spam-PAD-Report: Checked with SpamPAD <score>
**remove_header** [] (type `append`)
    Removes all header from message with the specified name. The value for this
    option must be in the following format::

         remove_header [all|spam|ham] [header_name]

**clear_headers** N/A (type `clear`)
    Clear all previously set options that add or remove headers (i.e. any
    from `add_header` or `remove_header`).

.. _reporting-options:

Reporting
---------

**report** [] (type `append`)
    A list of strings that form the report. The report can be returned when
    the CLI script is called with `-t` and is also included by default in
    messages that have been marked as spam. Note that this string will have
    any TAGS replaced with their values.
**clear_report_template** N/A (type `clear`)
    Clear the report list.
**report_safe** 1 (type `int`)
    When this option is set to 0 only header modification are made to the
    messages. In addition an X-Spam-Report will be added to the messages that
    contains the `report` for this message. Note this only applies to
    messages classified as spam.

    When this option is set to 1 and the messages is marked as spam, SpamPAD
    will generate a multipart/mixed messages. The new message will have
    `text/plain` part with the SpamPAD report and `message/rfc882` part with
    the original message.

    When the option is set to 2 instead of using a `messages/rfc882` content
    type, a text/plain one will be used instead.
**report_contact** None (type `str`)
    Set the contact address that is exposed in the `_CONTACTADDRESS_` tag.


.. _network-options:

Network Options
---------------

    Syntax::

        trusted_networks [!]IP_ADDRESS[/MASKLEN] [...]
        
        internal_networks [!]IP_ADDRESS[/MASKLEN] [...]
        
        msa_networks [!]IP_ADDRESS[/MASKLEN] [...]

    `!`
        excludes the network from the list
    `MASKLEN`
        the CIDR-style netmask length specified in bits. If it's not specified
        it will be deduced from the IP_ADDRESS
    `IP_ADDRESS`
        an IPv4 or IPv6 address optionally enclosed in square brackets. If no
        masklen is specified then one will be deduced from the ip like this: If
        the ip has less than 4 octets and ends with a trailing dot then the
        masklen is `num_octets * 8` if there is no trailing dot then the mask
        will be `32` for IPv4 addresses and `128` for IPv6 addresses

**trusted_networks** [] (type `append split`)

    You can specify multiple networks. With each network specified, it will be
    added to the list of trusted networks. 

    The networks are searched sequentially with the first match stopping the
    search, so you should write more specific subnets first.

    .. note::
        
        127.0.0.0/8 and ::1 are always included in trusted_networks and cannot
        be overriden

    Trusted networks in our case means that a relay host from one of these
    networks is considered out of the control of spammers, open relays, or open
    proxies. A trusted network could relay spam but spam will not originate
    from it and it will not forge header data. So we will not do dns blacklist
    checks for any host in these networks
    
    This setting should define the networks that you trust but are not internal
    relays or MXes for your domains

    Examples::

        # Trust all in 192.168.*.*
        
        trusted_networks 192.168.
        
        # or
        
        trusted_networks 192.168.0.0/16

        # Trust all in 192.168.*.* except those in 192.168.1.*
        
        trusted_networks !192.168.1. 192.168. 
        
        # or
        
        trusted_networks !192.168.1.0/24 192.168.0.0/16
        
        # or
        
        trusted_networks !192.168.1.0/24
        trusted_networks !192.168.0.0/16

**clear_trusted_networks** N/A (type `clear`)
    Empties the list of trusted networks. 127.0.0.0/8 and ::1 will still exist
    and they cannot be removed

**internal_networks** [] (type `append split`)
    When you define an internal network then all hosts in the network are
    considered to be MXes for your domains or internal relays.

    Internal networks are a subset of trusted networks so they will be added as
    a trusted network too 

    If trusted networks is set and internal_networks is not then trusted
    networks will also be considered internal networks. 

    .. note::

        127.0.0.0/8 and ::1 are always included in trusted_networks and cannot
        be overriden

**clear_internal_networks** N/A (type `clear`)
    Empties the list of internal networks. 127.0.0.0/8 and ::1 will still exist
    and they cannot be removed
    
**msa_networks** [] (type `append split`)
    MSA hosts, also known as MX relays are hosts that accept mail from your own
    users and authenticate them properly.

    These relays will never accept mail from hosts taht aren't authenticated in
    some way. If an MSA relays is found then all relays after it will get the
    same internal/trusted classification as that one

    When using msa_networks to identify an MSA host it is recommended to treat
    it as both trusted and internal. When an MSA is also acting as an MX or an
    intermediate relay you must always treat it as both trusted and internal
    and make sure that the MSA includes visible auth tokens in it's Received
    header 

    .. warning::

        You shouldn't include an msa that is also an MX or an intermediate
        relay for an MX in this setting because it will result in uknown
        external relays being trusted

**clear_msa_networks** N/A (type `clear`)
    Empties the list of msa networks


.. _dns-options:

DNS
---

**dns_server** [] (type `append`)
    Specify a list of nameservers to query when doing DNS lookups. These can
    specified as IPv4 or IPv6 address with an optional port followed. Example::

        dns_server 127.0.0.1
        
        dns_server 127.0.0.1:53
        
        dns_server [::1]:53

    If no such nameserver is specified, the default ones from `/etc/resolv.conf`
    will be used.
**clear_dns_servers** N/A (type `clear`)
    Clear any custom nameserver set by `dns_server`.

**default_dns_lifetime** 10.0 (type `float`)
    Sets the timeout for a full DNS lookup. I.e. any DNS lookup will have at
    most 10 seconds to get a valid response from one of the DNS server.

**default_dns_timeout** 2.0 (type `float`)
    Set the timeout for a DNS lookup from a single nameserver.
.. _dns_available:
**dns_available** yes ( type `str` )
    Configure whether DNS resolving is available or not. If you specify it as
    yes or no then no tests will be performed. Example::
        
        dns_available yes
        
        dns_available no
    
    If you want to determine the availability dynamically you can use the value
    `test` or `test: domain1 domain2 ... domainN`. In that case a query will be
    performed for three of the domain names given chosen at random. If any of
    them gives a response then dns will be considered available.
    The test will be performed again according to the 
    :ref: `dns_test_interval option <dns_test_interval>` Example::

        dns_available test:domain1 domain2 domain3 domain4

    If no domains are specified with the test option then a default list will
    be used Example::
        
        dns_available test

**dns_test_interval** 600s ( type `str` )
    If you set the :ref:`dns_available option <dns_available>` to `test` then
    by setting, the actual test will be performed no sooner that the interval
    you set here. You can set just a number or a number with a suffix to
    determine the the time unit (s, m, h, d, w) Example::
    
        dns_test_interval 600
        
        dns_test_interval 600s
        
        dns_test_interval 10m 

**dns_query_restriction** "" ( type `string` )
    Configure restrictions for querying the dns. Almost all dns queries are
    subject to the dns_query_restriction. Before performing a query the domain
    is tested against these restrictions and when a match occurs the the query
    is performed according to the allow/deny setting for that match. If no
    match is found then the query is allowed by default.
    
    when testing a domain it's labels are stripped succesively to check if a
    parent matches. 
        
    All of the following would be denied example.com, 1.example.com
    1.2.example.com ::

        dns_query_restriction deny example.com

    This way 1.example.com 2.1.example.com would be denied
    but example.com would be allowed ::

        dns_query_restriction deny 1.example.com

    You can deny a wider group of domains and only allow one subgroup like this::

        dns_query_restriction deny example.com
        dns_query_restriction allow 1.example.com

    In this case example.com and all of it's subdomsins would be denied except
    1.example.com and all of it's subdomains which would be allowed
