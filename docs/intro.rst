Running tests
=============

To run the project's tests you will need to first:

#. Create a python virtualenv and activate it *(Recommended only)*
#. Clone the repository from GitHub.
#. Install the base dependencies from `requirements/base.txt` with pip
#. Install the the dependencies for the python version you are using from the
   `requirements` folder
#. Install the dependencies for running tests from `requirements/tests.txt`
#. Download the GeoIP database::

    wget http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCountry/GeoIP.dat.gz
    gunzip GeoIP.dat.gz
    wget http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoIPv6.dat.gz
    gunzip GeoIPv6.dat.gz

The SpamPAD tests are split into *unittest* and *functional* tests.

*Unitests* perform checks against the current source code and **not**
the installed version of SpamPAD. To run all the unittests suite::

    py.test tests/unit/

*Functional* tests perform checks against the installed version of
SpamPAD and **not** the current source code. These are more extensive
and generally take longer to run. They also might need special setup.
To run the full suite of functional tests::

    py.test tests/functional/

Or you can run *all* the tests with just::

    py.tests

.. note::

    See also the `.travis.yml` file where all these instructions are set
    for the automatic builds.
