Like any open-source project, OrangeAssassin owes much to everyone that has contributed to the project, in many ways.

If you make a contribution, please add yourself to this file in your pull-request, so that we properly credit you.

== Apache Software Foundation ==

The Apache Software Foundation provide the [SpamAssassin project](http://spamassassin.apache.org), which OrangeAssassin is based on. Without them, this project would not exist! All credit for the concepts, overall design, and, most importantly, the rules, are due to the many contributors of that project, from Justin Mason through to everyone else.
